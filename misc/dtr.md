# Rails Engine
##### Parker Phillips & Colin Osborn     

##### -- What are your learning goals for the project?
Parker: I'm most concerned about learning advanced ActiveRecord     
Colin: Same ActiveRecord goals, more api exposure     

###### -- What is your collaboration style?
Parker: Divide and conquer is my favorite way to go     
Colin: Prefer to work closer, wants to try more dividing and conquering     

##### -- How do you communicate best? How do you appreciate receiving communication from others?
Parker: Brutally honest, and as it comes up
Colin: Basically the same

##### -- How would you describe your work style
Parker: I really like a list of things to do, want to focus and not procrastinate it.     
Colin: Likes the idea of the to-do list, no preference for time.     

##### -- What has gone well or poorly in previous projects?
Parker: Work has always been finished, I have been slacking on TDD     
Colin: Taken too much of a backseat, wasn't pushing himself

##### -- What do you need to do your best work?
Parker: Not working in the mornings, my commute has changed so getting out on time is more of a priority.     
Colin: Good communication is very important

##### -- What scheduling restraints do you have? What are your scheduling preferences?
Parker: Can't get here very early, have to leave on time due to transportation. So no room for preferences.     
Colin: Whenever/Wherever

##### -- What is your style for giving feedback? Does anything ever hold you back from giving feedback?
Parker: I typically deliver it a couple days late. I like to reflect on the project for a few days after the stress has subsided so that my thought process for feedback is clear and unclouded by the stresses of said project.     
Colin: Same way, likes to take a couple days to process the project experience

##### -- What are your technical skills? What do you need to work on?
Parker: I learn things pretty quickly and am generally good at figuring things out. I need to improve on not panicking during the project. Testing is still weak     
Colin: Easy to work with, solid work ethic. Needs to gain confidence still, feels this project will be a good opportunity

##### -- What tools do you want to use?
Waffle and github

##### -- How do you want to solve problems when we run into them?
We will be working on similar issues, so when we hit a roadbump communicate with the other person to see if they can help, ask mentors, and pairing.

##### -- How do you know when a project is successful? How can we achieve that?
Parker: Early on in Turing I felt the project was a success when I received all passing marks, at this point I feel that the project was a success when all of the learning goals have been achieved - regardless of the scores.
Colin: Pretty much the same thing, the learning goals are what is important.
We can achieve this by checking in with each other on weak points.
